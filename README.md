# Views

## Your bookshelves

You have three bookshelves in which to store your favourite books: currently 
reding, want to read and read.
 
This is the initial view of the application, where you can simply move books 
between bookshelves by making a selection from the dropdown associated with 
any book.

## Searching for books

Here you can search for books using the terms provided in SEARCH_TERMS.md. 
When typing, search results will automatically appear if there are any 
matches. You can add any books from a search on to any of your bookshelves. If 
you navigate back to the bookshelves view, you will see any books that you 
have added from your search.
